SHAP Analysis of Bankruptcy Prediction Model
This project requires students to build and rigorously interpret a predictive model for corporate bankruptcy using a prepared financial dataset (e.g., based on Altman Z-score components or similar features). The focus is not just on achieving high predictive accuracy but on the interpretability of the final model, specifically using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. Students must first develop a robust classification model (e.g., XGBoost or Random Forest) and tune its hyperparameters. Following model training, the core task involves generating global and local SHAP explanations to understand feature importance and individual prediction justifications. The analysis should deeply explore how specific financial ratios contribute positively or negatively to the probability of bankruptcy across different segments of the dataset. Students must critically evaluate the model's behavior, identify potentially counter-intuitive feature effects, and document the business insights derived from the SHAP analysis, moving beyond simple feature importance scores to practical, actionable interpretations.
# Tasks to Complete:
1. Develop, train, and optimize a high-performing binary classification model (e.g., XGBoost) on the provided financial dataset for bankruptcy prediction, including proper cross-validation.
2. Calculate and visualize global feature importance using SHAP summary plots to understand overall model drivers.
3. Select three distinct case examples (predictions) from the test set and generate local SHAP force plots and dependence plots to explain individual predictions in detail.
4. Write a critical analysis comparing the model's overall feature importance derived from standard feature importance metrics versus SHAP values, focusing on any discrepancies.
5. Synthesize findings into a concise text-based report detailing the most influential financial factors predicting distress and the business implications of these findings.
